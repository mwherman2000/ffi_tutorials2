# Creating Language Wrappers For Rust Libraries - Part 1


## Background
Modern software applications are commonly written for multiple computing platforms that each have their own unique sets of capabilities, APIs, and preferred programming languages.  For software developers, this often means creating architectural designs and writing code for one platform and then moving <i>most</i> of the design to the next platform where they restart the coding effort using a different programming language.  This results in a lot of duplicated effort.

To save time and facilitate code reuse, it is common practice to consolidate the business logic of software components into reusable statically-linked or dynamically-linked libraries.  When libraries are created using programming languages that are different from the importing applications, the library is considered *foreign code* by the application.  In order to communicate between the application and library, a common calling and data exchange protocol must be established.  This common protocol is referred to as a [*Foreign Function Interface (FFI)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).  

Creating an FFI layer can be very complex.  Part of this complexity is due to the application needing to comply with the memory management requirements introduced by the imported library.  This situation often makes programming difficult for application developers who may be required use the unfamiliar *unsafe* methods (e.g., C-style pointers, allocate, free, etc.) rather than the usual safe methods they regularly use.  For a quick example of how FFI works, please see [Simple Rust Library Foreign Function Interface](https://github.com/sudoplatform-labs/ffi-tutorials/blob/main/Quick_FFI_Intro)

## Tutorial

This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a linkable library using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and expose interface methods using FFI.  However, in addition to regular FFI, this example will also show how to specify and generate a language-specific *wrapper*.  Using wrappers will insulate developers from the memory management issues described above by exposing a set of methods that more closely resemble those of the application's programming language and models.  This has several benefits, including reducing the overall level of effort for library developers while also simplifying the complexity of including foreign libraries for application developers.

The library created in this tutorial will expose a single function that will receive an input boolean value and return the opposite value.  This tutorial will walk through the process of defining the library interface functions and then generating a language-specific wrapper layer.  Further, this tutorial will demonstrate how to import this library into two distinct user-level applications that are implemented in Python and Swift.


## Mozilla's uniffi Tool Automates FFI Processes

Rust is a very compelling programming language, because it combines the execution speed of lower-level languages (e.g., C) while providing very effective memory management and error checking capabilities that are similar to other modern languages (e.g., Swift).  Rust also provides solid FFI capabilities and is able to interface with most common application languages.  As a result, cross-platform developers are looking to Rust when they create libraries that target multiple platforms.  However, as described above, FFI is a difficult and time-consuming process that creates implementation difficulties for upper-level application developers.

To simplify the process of creating language wrappers, [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) has created a software development tool called *uniffi* (see [https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs)).   The uniffi tool performs much of the teddious and error-prone coding that is necessary for FFI creation.  It also generates language-specific wrappers with resulting API code that is more familiar and easier for application developers to use.  From the [uniffi User Guide](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/):

*"Uniffi is a tool that automatically generates foreign-language bindings targeting Rust libraries.  It fits in the practice of consolidating business logic in a single Rust library while targeting multiple platforms, making it simpler to develop and maintain a cross-platform codebase."*

The uniffi User Guide also presents the following overview of uniffi's main architectural components:

![](./docs/uniffi_architecture.png)

The 3 main elements in this diagram include:  the Interface Definition File, the Rust Scaffolding, and the language-specific bindings.  Using uniffi, developers can automatically generate language-specific bindings for Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS & macOS), Python, Ruby, and C++, which will greatly improve development time for those environments.

With the uniffi tools, the high-level wrapper generation process is as follows:

1. Create a custom Rust library
	1. Expose the desired API for the library.  The API will consist of all top-level functions
	2. Setup a Cargo.toml file that specifies that the crate will be built as a dylib
	3. Build and test the library

2. Create a [*UDL*](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/udl_file_spec.html) representation of each of the API functions
	1. UDL is a uniffi-specific design language that is a variation of Web Interface Definition Language (Web IDL)
	2. The UDL file will describe each of the top-level functions in the library

3. Use the uniffi tool to create a [*scaffolding layer*](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/tutorial/Rust_scaffolding.html) for the library
	1. The scaffolding layer is a set of helper code that is used to make the top-level functions available to the foreign-language bindings

4. Create language-specific [bindings](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/tutorial/foreign_language_bindings.html)
	1. This makes FFI calls look & feel like native code (e.g., Swift FFI feels like native Swift)

5. Import the scaffolding code, the language-specific code, and the generated library into a native application


## Installing uniffi
Installing the uniffi tools is easily performed with *cargo*, as follows:

```
cargo install uniffi_bindgen@0.23.0
```
Note:  at the time this tutorial was last updated, uniffi-bindgen version 0.23.0 is the most current stable version.  The '@0.23.0' segment above informs cargo which version to install.  Future uniffi-bindgen versions can be installed by specifying the particular version.

## Creating the Rust Library
To get started, open a terminal window and create a project directory that will contain each of the library and applications for this tutorial.  In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and create a new Rust library called *library*, as follows:

```
cargo new --lib library
``` 

Next, navigate into the new *library* sub-directory just created, open Cargo.toml, and add the following:

```
[package]
name = "library"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Steve McCown <smccown@anonyome.com>"]
license = "Apache version 2.0"
edition = "2018"
build = "build.rs"

[dependencies]
uniffi = { version = "0.23.0" }
uniffi_bindgen = "0.23.0"

[build-dependencies]
uniffi = { version = "0.23.0", features = [ "build", "cli"] }

[[bin]]
name = "uniffi-bindgen"
path = "uniffi-bindgen.rs"
  
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
name = "library"
```

The ```[dependencies]``` section instructs cargo to load and use uniffi version 0.23.0.  (uniffi-bindgen is now built while building the app and is described below.). ```[build-dependencies]``` section instructs cargo to use uniffi version 0.23.0 and references the *build* and *cli* features.  *cli* is specified to allow building the uniffi-bindgen tool.  The ```[bin``` section shows that a binary target called *uniffi-bindgen* will be created from a file called uniffi-bindgen.rs (located next to the Cargo.toml file).  The ```[lib]``` section allows developers to specify that the target is a cdylib and *name* is user defined.  For this tutorial, it is cimply called *library*, so it's clear what is being created.


Now, go into the src sub-directory, edit lib.rs, and add the following lines to the top of the file:

```
uniffi::include_scaffolding!("library");
   
fn bool_inc_test(value: bool) -> bool {
   
    return !value
}   
```

The uniffi include macro instructs the Rust compiler to load the scaffolding code, which will be generated during the build process.  The Rust function being exported is a simple function that receives a boolean value and returns its inverse.  Since ```bool_inc_test( )``` is a top-level function, it is part of the API that the library will expose externally ... which is convenient, since it's the only function in the library.  

## Create The uniffi-bindgen Executable

A previously described, the Cargo.toml file contains a reference to the uniffi-bindgen binary, which looks like this:

```
[[bin]]
name = "uniffi-bindgen"
path = "uniffi-bindgen.rs"
```

To create the uniffi-bindgen executable tailored to your environment, create a new file called *uniffi-bindgen.rs* next to Cargo.toml and add:

```
fn main() {

    uniffi::uniffi_bindgen_main()
}
```

Once uniffi-bindgen is built and run, it will call main(), which will call the uniffi-bindgen code contained within the uniffi crate.  The purpose of these steps is to give Cargo something to build / call that is wholly dependent on the specific versions contained within the particular uniffi crate.  This makes things simpler when new versions are installed, as well as, simplifying the build process.

To build the uniffi-bindgen binary, please execute the following:

```
cargo run --features=uniffi/cli --bin uniffi-bindgen
```
Once the build process completes, it should display something like this:

```
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1m 01s
     Running `target/debug/uniffi-bindgen`
uniffi-bindgen 0.23.0
Scaffolding and bindings generator for Rust

    -V, --version    Print version information

SUBCOMMANDS:

    print-json     Print the JSON representation of the interface from a dynamic library
    scaffolding    Generate Rust scaffolding code
```


## Create the UDL File
With the Rust library created and its API defined, it's time to create the UDL file.  Staying in the library/src directory, create a file called *library.udl*.  The naming convention is such that the name 'library' is the name chosen in this tutorial for the library and '.udl' shows that it's a uniffi UDL file.  Add the following lines to the new UDL file:

```
namespace library {

    boolean bool_inc_test(boolean value);

};
```

In UDL, all of the API functions must be specified in the UDL file under the *namespace* block.  The UDL reads like a type of pseudocode that easily describes the function definition.  The types used in this file adhere to the [UDL specification](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/udl_file_spec.html).  UDL can be used to specify many other types, enumerations, structs, dictionaries, interfaces, objects, and errors; however, those are not covered in this tutorial. 

## Generate The Scaffolding Layer

The *scaffolding layer* is set of code that exposes the library's API and serializes the specified data types as an enhanced FFI layer.  In previous uniffi versions, the scaffolding layer used to be generated from the command terminal.  Starting in version 0.23.0, this is accomplished in the *build.rs* file, which cargo uses to perform build steps.  To do this, create build.rs next to Cargo.toml and add the following:

```
fn main() {

	uniffi::generate_scaffolding("./src/library.udl").unwrap();
}
```

This call will generate the scaffolding layer code from the library.udl file created above and will make it available for import into *lib.rs* at build time.


## Build the Rust Library

At this point, the wrapper has been specified, uniffi-bindgen has been built, and the scaffolding layer has been created.  Now it is time to build the library from the library sub-directory and typing:

```
cargo build
```

This will build the Rust library according to the settings in Cargo.toml.  If everything is successful, the output should be similar to:

```
% cargo build
    Compiling library v0.1.0 (./ffi-tutorials/Wrapper_Intro/library)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.75s
```

## Generate the Swift Language Wrapper

At this point, the newly created *uniffi-bindgen* can be called with:

 ```cargo run --features=uniffi/cli --bin uniffi-bindgen [args]```

where *args* refers to the language wrapper being created.  So, for Swift, the call would look like 

```cargo run --bin uniffi-bindgen generate src/library.udl --language swift```

Executing this command will create *libraryFFI.h*, *libraryFFI.modulemap*, and (for Swift) *library.swift*.  *library.swift* is a file of ~365 lines of code that contains the Swift wrapper code.  Our function of interest ```bool_inc_test( )``` will appear as follows:


```
342  public func boolIncTest(value: Bool) -> Bool {
343      return try! FfiConverterBool.lift(
344          try!
345  
346              rustCall {
347                  library_eb66_bool_inc_test(
348                      FfiConverterBool.lower(value), $0
349                  )
350              }
351      )
352  }
```

This code calls the FFI code (generated by uniffi) that performs the actual functions of calling into the library, sending / retrieving parameters, etc.  For fun, feel free to browse through the rest of the *library.swift* (or other language) file to see the FFI complexity that is saved by uniffi.  While it is definately possible to craft the FFI code by hand, it is a steep climb for application programmers who are not also C-programmers.  For that reason, a language-specific wrapper function definately simplifies calls into the library.


## Generate the Python Language Wrapper

To generate the Python language wrapper, run 

```cargo run --bin uniffi-bindgen generate src/library.udl --language python```

Executing this command will create *library.py*, which is a file of ~433 lines of code that contains the Python wrapper code.  Our function of interest ```bool_inc_test( )``` will appear as follows:


```
420  def bool_inc_test(value):
421      value = bool(value)
422    
423      return FfiConverterBool.lift(rust_call(_UniFFILib.library_eb66_bool_inc_test,
424          FfiConverterBool.lower(value)))
```

This code calls other FFI code (generated by uniffi) that performs the actual functions of calling into the library, sending / retrieving parameters, etc.  For fun, feel free to browse through the rest of the *library.py* file to see the FFI complexity that is saved by uniffi.


## Swift Application: Calling the Rust Library

Once the library has been created, the scaffolding layer generated, and the Swift language wrapper generated, it is time to test importing the library into a Swift application.  To test this part of the tutorial, a macOS Swift app will be created.  To create the test app, do the following:

1. Launch Xcode and select File | New | Project  
2. Click *macOS* for the new project template
3. Select *Command Line Tool* and click *Next*
4. Name the project *swift\_test\_app* and click *Next*
5. A dialog box will appear asking where to save the project.  Select the main tutorial directory used for this tutorial and press *Create*

The preceeding steps will result in an empty, but runnable, Swift-based command line tool for macOS.  Next, the library must be linked and the scaffolding layer and language bindings must be added to the Xcode project, as follows:

1. In Xcode, select the target *swift_test_app*, select *General*, and add the Rust library (../library/target/debug/liblibrary.dylib) to the *Frameworks and Libraries* section, as follows:
![](./docs/xcode_project_library.png)
2. Add the directory containing the Rust library (dylib) to the Xcode project's *Library Search Paths*
3. Add the Swift language files generated by uniffi above.  The files to be added include
	1. libraryFFI.h
	2. libraryFFI.modulemap
	3. library.swift

	![](./docs/xcode_project_files.png)
4. Add the bridging header to the Xcode target by adding *../library/src/libraryFFI.h* to *Swift Compiler - General*

At this point, the test app should import the required files, link to the library, and run ... without doing anything.  To test the library, it is necessary to add some function calls to *main.swift*, as follows:

```
1  //
2  //  main.swift
3  //  swift_test_app
4  //
5  //  Created by Steven H. McCown on 2/9/21.
6  //
7	import Foundation
8
9	print(" --- Running boolean test ---")
8	let valueBool: Bool = false
9	var resultBool: Bool = boolIncTest(value: valueBool)
10	assert(!valueBool == resultBool, "Bool test failed")
11
12	print(" --- All Tests Succeded! --- ")

```
In this very simple test, *valueBool* is initialized to *false* on line 8.  This value is passed to the function *boolIncTest( )* on line 9 and the return value is stored in resultBool.  On line 10, an assert statement compares the 2 values to ensure that they are different.  If *boolIncTest( )* is successfuly called from the linked library and a valid result value is received, then the following message should be displayed:

```
 --- Running Tests --- 
Running boolean test...
 --- All Tests Succeded! --- 
Program ended with exit code: 0
```
<BR>

## Python Application: Calling the Rust Library

Creating the Python test application is much simpler than the Swift version, because it does not need a project configuration.  To create the Python test application, do the following:

1. Go to the tutorial main directory and create a sub-directory called *python_test_app* and navigate into it
2. Copy the required library files into *python_test_app*
	1. ./library/target/debug/libuniffi_library.dylib (*Note:  currently, building the Rust library creates a filed called liblibrary.dylib.  As part of this copy step, the library should be renamed as libuniffi__library.dylib.  This descrepancy will likely be resolved in future versions of uniffi.*)
	2. ./library/src/library.py
3. Create the main Python application file (main.py) and add the following:

```
1 import library
2 
3 value = True
4 print('\n The opposite of ' + str(value) + ' is ' + str(library.bool_inc_test(value)) + '\n')
```

To execute main.py, type

```
python3 main.py
```

If *library.bool_inc_test( )* was successfully invoked, the following output should be displayed int the terminal:

```
% python3 main.py

 The opposite of True is False

% 
```

## Conclusion

Developing reusable libraries in Rust is an exellent way to build the business logic once and then reuse it across several languages and platforms.  While FFI makes it possible to call Rust libraries from a variety of different programming languages, its requirement for application developers to make C-language calls into linked libraries is confusing and burdensome.  The uniffi tool from Mozilla dramatically simplifies the software development process by automatically generating the scaffolding layer and building language-specific bindings, which simplify the integration effort for application developers. The next tutorial builds upon the processes presented and demonstrates how to exchange data between Rust libraries and applications written in upper level languages, such as Swift and Python (please see [Creating Language Wrappers For Rust Libraries - Part 2](https://github.com/sudoplatform-labs/ffi-tutorials/blob/main/Wrapper_Data_Types)).
